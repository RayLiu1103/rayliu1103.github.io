I will be joining the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at **University of Kansas** as a **Ph.D. student in Fall 2025**, where I will pursue research in the fields of data science.

I obtained my master's degree from the School of  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/), under the supervision of Dr. [Thinh Nguyen](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~thinhq/).

My research interests include **reinforcement learning**, **data science**, and **LLM**.
