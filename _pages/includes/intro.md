I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Kansas, advised by Dr. [Dongjie Wang](https://wangdongjie100.github.io/). 

My research focuses on *tabular data mining* and *tabular foundation models*, particularly exploring the integration of *large language models (LLMs)*, *federated learning*, and *causal inference* to build efficient, interpretable, and scalable data science systems.

I obtained my master's degree from the School of  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/), under the supervision of Dr. [Thinh Nguyen](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~thinhq/) and Dr. [Jinsub Kim](https://sites.google.com/a/cornell.edu/jinsub-kim/home).
