I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Kansas, pursuing research in the field of data science.

I obtained my master's degree from the School of  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/), under the supervision of Dr. [Thinh Nguyen](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~thinhq/).

My research interests include **reinforcement learning**, **data science**, and **LLM**.
